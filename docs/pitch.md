# 🟢 E-PUNCH.io — Pitch Guide for Small Business Owners

## 🔹 1. Quick Overview (The Elevator Pitch)

**E-PUNCH.io** is a super simple digital loyalty card system.

Your customers get a QR code on their phone. You scan it when they buy something, and they collect digital punches. After a certain number of visits—say 10—they get a reward, like a free coffee.

It’s like the old punch cards… but without the paper. And it actually works.

## 🔹 2. How It Works (Clear Explanation)

Here’s how it plays out in real life:

1. **Customer walks into your shop.**
2. They either scan *your* QR code or go to `epunch.io`.
3. On their phone, they see their punch cards—including yours.
4. After they buy something, you scan *their* personal QR code.
5. Their punch count goes up instantly.
6. When they hit the reward (like 10 punches), it tells them: “Free coffee ready!” — they show you, you scan again, and it resets.
7. They’re happy. You just got yourself a regular customer.

👉 No logins, no apps. Works straight from the browser.
