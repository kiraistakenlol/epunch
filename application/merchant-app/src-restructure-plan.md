# Merchant App Source Restructure Plan ✅ COMPLETED

## Current Issues
- Mixed v1/v2 versioning structure
- Deep nesting in merchant-onboarding (40+ components)  
- Business logic scattered across components
- Inconsistent feature organization

## New Clean Structure
```
src/
├── app/                    # Main app files
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── routes.ts
├── components/             # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/                # shadcn/ui components (30+ files)
│   └── shared/            # Custom shared components
├── features/              # Feature-based modules
│   ├── auth/              # Login functionality
│   ├── dashboard/         # Dashboard pages & components
│   ├── design/            # Design editor & preview
│   ├── loyalty-programs/  # Loyalty program management
│   ├── onboarding/        # Merchant onboarding flow
│   └── scanner/           # QR scanner functionality
├── hooks/                 # Shared custom hooks
├── lib/                   # Utilities, configs, helpers
├── services/              # API calls, business logic
├── store/                 # Redux state management
└── styles/                # Global styles
```

## Migration Steps

### 1. Create New Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/{app,components/shared,features/{auth,dashboard,design,loyalty-programs,onboarding,scanner},services}
```

### 2. Move Main App Files
- `App.tsx` → `app/App.tsx`
- `main.tsx` → `app/main.tsx`  
- `lib/routes.ts` → `app/routes.ts`

### 3. Reorganize Features
- `pages/login/*` → `features/auth/`
- `pages/v2/dashboard/*` → `features/dashboard/`
- `components/v2/design/*` → `features/design/components/`
- `pages/v2/design/*` → `features/design/pages/`
- `pages/v2/loyalty-programs/*` → `features/loyalty-programs/`
- `pages/merchant-onboarding/*` → `features/onboarding/`
- `components/v2/scanner/*` → `features/scanner/components/`
- `pages/v2/scanner/*` → `features/scanner/pages/`

### 4. Move Shared Components
- `components/v2/layout/*` → `components/shared/layout/`
- `components/v2/data-display/*` → `components/shared/data-display/`

### 5. Reorganize Services & Utils
- `utils/dashboardPreviewService.ts` → `services/dashboardPreview.ts`
- `utils/punchCardPreviewService.ts` → `services/punchCardPreview.ts`
- `utils/onboardingImageUtil.ts` → `services/imageUtils.ts`
- `lib/utils.ts` → `lib/cn.ts` (classnames utility)

### 6. Update All Imports
- Update relative imports to use new paths
- Add path aliases in tsconfig.json if needed
- Ensure all feature modules are self-contained

### 7. Clean Up Empty Directories
- Remove `pages/v2/`, `components/v2/` 
- Remove old `utils/` directory
- Remove old `lib/` directory

## Benefits
- ✅ Feature-based organization
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns  
- ✅ Easier maintenance and scaling
- ✅ Consistent project structure
- ✅ Better developer experience
