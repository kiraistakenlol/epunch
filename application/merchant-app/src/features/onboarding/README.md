# Merchant Onboarding

Sales pitch page for potential merchant clients.

This is a typical sales landing page that lists all the advantages of e-punch and convinces business owners (cafes, restaurants, barbershops, etc.) to adopt the loyalty system. It's personalized with their specific branding and shows how e-punch would work for their business.

The goal is to sell the product by demonstrating its benefits and value proposition in a merchant-specific context.
