TODO:

merchant app update: 
- new base page for auth (simple auth using login and password)
- basically it has to look like an admi panel. research what solution allows to build admin-like solution really quickly. then build a left menu with two items:
 - scan page that leads to the current scan page
 - loyalty programs page: show existing ones, create a new one, view an existing one.
