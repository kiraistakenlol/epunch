# E-PUNCH.io Progress Log

## DONE:
- âœ… **Animation for new punches**: Implemented smooth punch circle animations with golden glow effect
- âœ… **Animation for new cards**: Added slide-in animations for newly created punch cards  
- âœ… **Single event architecture**: Consolidated PUNCH_ADDED and CARD_CREATED into one event to eliminate race conditions
- âœ… **Animation timing improvements**: New card animations now wait 1.5 seconds after punch animations complete
- âœ… **Animation interruption protection**: Prevent new animations from interrupting ongoing ones
- âœ… **Restructure of DashboardPage.tsx**: 
  - Extracted `PunchCardsSection` component for better separation of concerns
  - Extracted `PunchCardItem` component for better modularity
  - Simplified main DashboardPage to focus only on layout
- âœ… **Mobile-first layout**: Converted from CSS Grid to Flexbox with proper viewport handling
- âœ… **Code organization**: Clean component architecture with single responsibility principle

## TODO:
- ðŸ”² **User login and bind current user with persistent user (Cognito)**: Implement authentication system
- ðŸ”² **Open app via link connected to loyalty program**: Deep linking functionality for merchant QR codes
- ðŸ”² **Debug reward message**: The "ðŸŽ‰ You've got a new punch and your reward is ready!" alert never appears
