## Content Elements

### 1. Business Impact Section (from Approach 1)

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">
            <div>

    </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Transaction Speed Highlight
**Why we like it:** Emphasizes the efficiency and simplicity of the process.

- **Key Message:** "2 sec Transaction time"
- **Usage:** Should be prominently featured as a key benefit
- **Context:** Perfect for highlighting the speed advantage over traditional punch cards

## Visual Elements

### 3. Dual-View Role Separation (from Combined Approach)
**Why we like it:** Shows both merchant and customer perspectives clearly.

- **Design Pattern:** Side-by-side layout with merchant view (green background) and customer view (blue background)
- **Role Badges:** Clear "YOU" vs "Customer" labels with color coding
- **Phone Mockups:** Visual representation of customer's phone experience
- **Action Descriptions:** Clear "What you do" vs "What they do" explanations
