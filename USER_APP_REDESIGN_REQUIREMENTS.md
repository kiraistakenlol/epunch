   - Physical punch hole representations
2. **Full-Size Display:** Punch cards should be shown full-size (fit into the screen) when viewed

   - Punch holes/stamps should look like actual physical punches
   - Clear visual distinction between filled and empty punches
4. **Unique Card Identity:** Each card should have:
   - Unique color schemes per merchant (subtle, not overwhelming)
   - Custom punch icons (coffee cups, stars, etc.)
   - Merchant-specific branding elements (logo, colors)
   - Distinctive but minimal visual patterns
5. **Minimalistic Design Principles:**
   - Clean typography
   - Ample white space
   - Subtle color palettes
   - Focus on essential information only
6. **Progress Visualization:** Clear visual representation of completion status
7. **Interactive Elements:** Cards should respond to user interactions with appropriate feedback
