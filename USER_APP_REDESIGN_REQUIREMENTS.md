## üé® Design Considerations

### Layout Options for QR Code
1. **Always Visible:** Keep QR prominent (current approach)
2. **On-Demand Modal:** Show QR via floating button/modal
3. **Dedicated QR Tab:** Separate screen for QR code
4. **Context-Aware:** Show QR based on user context (at merchant, reward ready)

### Card Display Patterns
1. **Horizontal Scroll:** Current approach (good for browsing)
2. **Grid Layout:** Better space utilization for many cards
3. **List View:** Searchable, detailed information
4. **Stacked/Wallet:** iOS wallet-style interface

### Navigation Patterns
1. **Bottom Tab Bar:** 4-5 main sections
2. **Drawer Navigation:** Expandable side menu
3. **Hybrid:** Bottom tabs + drawer for secondary features

## üîÑ Key User Flows

### Primary Flow: Getting a Punch
1. User visits merchant
2. Opens app ‚Üí QR code visible/accessible
3. Merchant scans QR
4. Real-time update shows new punch
5. Animation feedback + progress update

### Secondary Flow: Reward Redemption
1. Card completion notification
2. User navigates to reward details
3. QR code switches to redemption mode
4. Merchant scans + redeems
5. Card archives to history

### Discovery Flow: Finding Shop Cards
1. User has many cards (50+)
2. Search/filter by shop name
3. Quick access to specific card
4. View shop information
