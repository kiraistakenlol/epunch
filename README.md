# E-PUNCH.io

A simple electronic punch card system.

Users have a personal QR code and digital punch cards for various businesses. Businesses scan the user's QR code to add punches. Accumulated punches lead to rewards.

## Application

### User App

#### Features

1. Personal QR code for quick punch collection
2. View and manage digital punch cards for multiple businesses
4. Track punch progress across different loyalty programs
5 Authentication is not required (user id is generated on the frontend and user is created on the first punch, later on sign up the external_id is linked to this user)
6. Authentication is available via google and email/password
7. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections when punch cards is complete or/and a new punch received
8. Animated punch card interactions and completion flows
9. Development page and api for testing and debugging (`/dev` route and `/api/v1/dev` endpoint) - **restricted to super admin users only** in user-app

#### User Basic Journey

**Visiting "Pottery Cafe"**

1. I walk into "Pottery Cafe" and scan their QR code (or open `epunch.io` manually).
2. I see my personal QR code on `epunch.io` and my list of punch cards.
   * If it's my first time at Pottery Cafe:
     * If I scanned their QR code: I might see a new "Pottery Punch Card" with 0/10 punches right away.
     * If I opened `epunch.io` manually: The "Pottery Punch Card" will appear in my list only *after* the manager scans my QR code for the first time (usually showing 1/10 punches).
   * If I've been here before, I see my existing "Pottery Punch Card" with its current punch count (e.g., n/10).
3. I buy a coffee and show my QR code to the manager.
4. The manager scans my QR code, selects 'Pottery Punch Card' loyalty program, presses "PUNCH".
5. I see my "Pottery Punch Card" on `epunch.io` update with +1 punch.
6. When my card shows 10/10 punches ("Reward Ready!"):
   * I press on the punch card, the QR code changes, now it's linked to the punch card
   * I show the merchant the QR code.
   * Merchant scans the QR code via merchant-app, and sees the REDEEM button and loyalty program description.
   * Merchant presses REDEEM
   * The punch card dissapears from my screen in user-app.
   * Merchant gives me a free coffee.
   * If the loyalty program is active, I automatically get a new punch card that belogs to the same loyalty program with 0/10 punches.

**Visiting a Different Cafe ("Cafe B")**

1. I visit "Cafe B" and scan their QR code (or open `epunch.io`).
2. After buying something and the manager scans my QR code for the first time:
   * I see a new "Cafe B Punch Card" appear in my list on `epunch.io`, starting with 1 punch (or 0).

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
* **User App (Frontend):** React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux
* **Merchant App (Frontend):** React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux, shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
* **Admin App (Frontend):** React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux, Material UI
* **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js framework), TypeScript, PostgreSQL client (pg)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase as database host)
* **Real-time Communication:** WebSocket (Socket.io) for live updates
* **Package Manager:** Yarn
* **UI Framework:** Bootstrap 5 with React Bootstrap components and Bootstrap Icons (bundled in common-ui package)

### Infrastructure & Deployment
* **AWS** See [infra/README_INFRA.md](infra/README_INFRA.md) for detailed setup and deployment instructions

### Real-time Features

The application uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates:

* **Live punch updates:** Users see punch additions immediately without page refresh
* **Card completion notifications:** Real-time alerts when cards are completed
* **Reward redemption updates:** Instant feedback when rewards are claimed
* **Animation system:** Coordinated animations for punch additions and card completions

### Animation System

The application includes a sophisticated animation system for enhanced user experience:

* **Sequence-based animations:** Complex animation flows defined as step sequences
* **Event-driven progression:** Animations can wait for user interactions
* **Global components:** Alerts and overlays work across the entire application
* **State management:** Separate Redux slices for animation execution and UI state

See `ANIMATION_FLOW.md` for detailed documentation of the animation architecture.
