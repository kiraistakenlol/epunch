# E-PUNCH.io

A comprehensive digital loyalty platform offering multiple product types for businesses and customers.

Users have a personal QR code to interact with various loyalty products at different businesses. The platform supports multiple loyalty mechanisms: **punch cards** for earn-and-redeem programs, **bundles** for pre-paid packages with quantity tracking, and **discount cards** for percentage-based savings (coming soon). Businesses can mix and match these products to create tailored loyalty experiences for their customers.

#### User Journey Examples

**Scenario 1: First-Time Visit to "Pottery Cafe"**

1. I walk into "Pottery Cafe" and scan their QR code (or open `epunch.io` manually).
2. I see my personal QR code and my loyalty wallet.
3. I buy a coffee and show my QR code to the manager.
4. Manager scans my QR code and sees available loyalty options for their business:
   - **Punch Card**: "Coffee Loyalty" (10 coffees = 1 free)
   - **Bundle**: "Coffee Bundle" (buy 5 coffees in advance for discount)
   - **Discount Card**: "VIP Discount" (15% off all items) *(coming soon)*
5. Manager selects "Coffee Loyalty" punch card and adds a punch.
6. I now see a "Coffee Loyalty" punch card in my wallet showing "1/10 punches".

**Scenario 2: Purchasing a Bundle at "FitGym"**

1. I visit "FitGym" wanting to commit to regular workouts.
2. Manager scans my user QR code and shows me loyalty options:
   - **Punch Card**: "Workout Rewards" (10 visits = 1 free personal training)
   - **Bundle**: "Monthly Pass" (20 visits, 30-day validity, bulk discount)
3. I choose the bundle for better value and convenience.
4. Manager processes the "Monthly Pass" bundle - I now see it in my wallet: "20 visits remaining, expires in 30 days".

**Scenario 3: Using Different Products at the Same Business**

1. I return to "FitGym" with both a punch card and an active bundle.
2. I tap my "Monthly Pass" bundle - my QR switches to bundle mode.
3. Manager scans my bundle QR and redeems 1 visit (now "19 remaining").
4. Next visit, I might choose to earn punches instead by using my punch card QR mode.

**Multi-Business Loyalty Management**

My loyalty wallet shows products from multiple businesses:
- **Pottery Cafe**: Coffee punch card (3/10), VIP discount card *(coming soon)*
